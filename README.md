# Fashion-Item-Recognition
This project is a deep learning image classification system that is able to recognize different fashion items from input images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 grayscale images of 10 different fashion items.

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and is deployed using Flask to create a web application.
